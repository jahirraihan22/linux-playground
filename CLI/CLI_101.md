    command [options] [arguments]
    
  
  An argument can be used to specify something for the command to act upon. If the ls command is given the name of a directory as an argument, it lists the contents of that directory. In the following example, the /etc/ppp directory is used as an argument; the resulting output is a list of files contained in that directory:



    sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ppp                                 
    ip-down.d  ip-up.d 
    
 The **ls** command also accepts multiple arguments. To list the contents of both the /etc/ppp and /etc/ssh directories, pass them both as arguments:
    
    sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ppp /etc/ssh         
    /etc/ppp:                       
    ip-down.d  ip-up.d                                  
    /etc/ssh:                                                         
    moduli               ssh_host_dsa_key.pub     ssh_host_rsa_key      sshd_configssh_config
    ssh_host_ecdsa_key   ssh_host_rsa_key.pub         
    ssh_host_dsa_key     ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub   ssh_import_id

   ### 5.5.1 Internal Commands
    Also called built-in commands, internal commands are built into the shell itself. A good example is the cd (change directory) command as it is part of the Bash shell. When a user types the cd command, the Bash shell is already executing and knows how to interpret it, requiring no additional programs to be started.

    The type command identifies the cd command as an internal command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ type cd                                     
    cd is a shell builtin

### 5.5.2 External Commands

    External commands are binary executables stored in directories that are searched by the shell. If a user types the ls command, then the shell searches through the directories that are listed in the PATH variable to try to find a file named ls that it can execute.

    If a command does not behave as expected or if a command is not accessible that should be, it can be beneficial to know where the shell is finding the command or which version it is using. It would be tedious to have to manually look in each directory that is listed in the PATH variable. Instead, use the which command to display the full path to the command in question:

    which command
    The which command searches for the location of a command by searching the PATH variable.

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ which ls                                       
    /bin/ls                                                               
    sysadmin@localhost:~$ which cal                                        
    /usr/bin/cal
    External commands can also be executed by typing the complete path to the command. For example, to execute the ls command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ /bin/ls                                                   
    Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
    For external commands, the type command displays the location of the command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ type cal                                      
    cal is /usr/bin/cal
    In some cases the output of the type command may differ significantly from the output of the which command:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ type echo                                     
    echo is a shell builtin
    sysadmin@localhost:~$ which echo                                        
    /bin/echo
    Using the -a option of the type command displays all locations that contain the command named:

    sysadmin@localhost:~$ type -a echo                                      
    echo is a shell builtin                                                
    echo is /bin/echo
